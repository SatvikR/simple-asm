# Simple ASM

A few simple x86-64 programs written in assembly language

Uses the [Netwide Assembler](https://www.nasm.us/) (easy to install with most package managers)

Use `make` to assemble programs.

## About

The majority of the time I took when writing this was in writing the custom println procedure. I did not want to fully rewrite a printf equivalent but still wanted to print numbers with out the C standard library.

## Method

This project is used for me to learn assembly, I am by no means an expert. All of these programs were written in C by me beforehand. I compiled them by hand, which is why some of my comments refer to variables (the variables existed in the C programs)
